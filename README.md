# Hi, Iâ€™m Mark â€” QA Engineer & Automation Architect

I build automation systems that help teams ship faster without losing quality.  

Over 9 years of experience designing and scaling QA architectures across web, mobile, and API platforms. I specialize in **Cypress**, **Playwright**, and **CI/CD automation**, with a focus on reliability, maintainability, and measurable impact. Passionate about bringing stability to fast-moving development environments through modern, data-driven QA practices.

## What I Do
- Build complete QA ecosystems: automated, documented, and CI/CD-integrated  
- Engineer end-to-end test frameworks for UI, API, and mobile  
- Integrate QA into release pipelines with versioning, gates, and traceability  
- Mentor engineers and teams to scale QA with confidence  

---

## Core Skills
- **Automation:** Cypress, Playwright, Appium, Selenium  
- **API & Backend Testing:** Postman, REST, GraphQL, SQL validation  
- **CI/CD & DevOps:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP  
- **Quality Strategy:** Shift-left testing, release governance, observability  
- **AI & Innovation:** DOM mapping, auto-tagging, AI-assisted test generation  

---

## Highlights & Achievements
- Reduced regression cycles from **2 weeks to 1 day** via parallelized Cypress suites  
- Cut test flakiness by **60%+** with CI-driven stability dashboards  
- Led QA automation migration from Angular â†’ React without CI/CD disruption  
- Founded and led a QA Guild embedding shift-left practices org-wide  
- Developed internal frameworks and libraries now used across multiple teams
