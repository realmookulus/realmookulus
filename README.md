# 👋 Hi, I'm Mark

**Automation Engineer • AI Architect • Full-Stack Systems Strategist**
### 🛠️ Automation Specialist • QA Engineer • Systems Builder

Give me access.  
Give me a goal.  
Then sit back and relax — I’ll handle the heavy lifting.

I specialize in:
- 🔁 End-to-end Cypress automation
- 🧠 AI-assisted testing and tooling
- ⚙️ Custom DOM mapping + auto-tagging
- 🧪 Backend & API test coverage
- 🚀 Fast, clean, repeatable systems

I build scalable QA suites in hours, not weeks.  
Looking to supercharge your test coverage or deploy smarter automation?  
Let’s talk.

I don’t just use AI — I weaponize it.  
You give me an idea, I’ll build you an empire.  
Try me. 😉

🧱 Want More Than Just Tests?

If you need a full QA ecosystem, I build those too:
	•	🧪 Manual test plans (100–500+ cases)
	•	✅ Scalable E2E automation with Cypress
	•	🧰 GitHub Actions + Merge Rules
	•	🧩 Jira workflows, releases, traceability
	•	🔄 Slack + GitHub + CI/CD integration
	•	🚀 Automated QA reporting, tagging, and coverage visibility

From zero to fully operational QA system — I can build it, own it, and hand it off.

🔧 You’re offering:
	•	QA tooling setup
	•	Process automation
	•	Reporting + releases
	•	Merge + branching strategy
	•	Tagging systems and alerts
	•	And long-term scale with AI-powered efficiency
