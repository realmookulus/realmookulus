# Hi, I'm Mark — QA Engineer & Automation Architect

You’ve got a product.
You need clean, scalable QA — fast.
That’s what I do.

I build automation, test ecosystems, and AI-powered QA systems that scale without breaking your dev velocity.
**Automation Engineer • AI Architect • Full-Stack Systems Strategist**
### 🛠️ Automation Specialist • QA Engineer • Systems Builder

Give me access.  
Give me a goal.  
Then sit back and relax — I’ll handle the heavy lifting.

I specialize in:
